<h1>Change Tracker</h1>

<p>When writing plugins, particularly those that perform refactoring,
    it is useful to be able to verify the changes that have been applied to the model.
    <br>This plugin provides two views:
<ul>
    <li>a list of change sets and the axioms that have been added and removed</li>
    <li>a diff view that shows the axioms differences between two ontologies</li>
</ul>
