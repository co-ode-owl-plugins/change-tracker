<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>When writing plugins, particularly those that perform refactoring,
 it is useful to be able to verify the changes that have been applied to the model.
  <br>This plugin provides two views:<ul>
  <li>a list of changesets and the axioms that have been added and removed</li>
  <li>a diff view that shows the axioms differences between two ontologies</li>
 </ul>
